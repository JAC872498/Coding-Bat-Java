/*Given two arrays, A and B, of non-negative int scores.
A "special" score is one which is a multiple of 10, such as 40 or 90. 
Return the sum of largest special score in A and the largest special score in B. To practice decomposition,
write a separate helper method which finds the largest special score in an array. 
Write your helper method after your scoresSpecial() method in the JavaBat text area.*/
