/*This is slightly more difficult version of the famous FizzBuzz problem 
which is sometimes given as a first problem for job interviews. 
(See also: FizzBuzz Code.) Consider the series of numbers beginning at start and running up to but not including end,
so for example start=1 and end=5 gives the series 1, 2, 3, 4. 
Return a new String[] array containing the string form of these numbers, 
except for multiples of 3, use "Fizz" instead of the number,
for multiples of 5 use "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5 use "FizzBuzz".
In Java, String.valueOf(xxx) will make the String form of an int or other type.
This version is a little more complicated than the usual version since you have to allocate and index into an array instead of just printing,
and we vary the start/end instead of just always doing 1..100.*/

public int[] post4(int[] nums) {
  for(int n=nums.length;n>0;n--){

      int[] nums2=new int[nums.length-n];
      for(int n2=n;n2<nums.length;n2++){
        nums2[n2-n]=nums[n2];
      }
      return(nums2);
    }
